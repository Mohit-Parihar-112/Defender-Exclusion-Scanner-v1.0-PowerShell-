# Defender-Exclusion-Scanner-v1.0-PowerShell-
🛡️ PowerShell script that scans Windows Defender exclusions (folders, processes, file types, IPs) with animated UI, color-coded output, admin check, and flags suspicious entries like "cheat", "bypass", or "inject". Great for anti-cheat, forensic, or system security auditing.
